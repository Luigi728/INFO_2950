    "Questions For Reviewers:\n",
    "- Without having learned hypothesis testing yet, do the stuff I've done above provide the foundation for hypothesis testing?\n",
    "    - Should I be testing a hypothesis like whether it can accurate predict for a specific standard like Strong Wind or Gale Wind?\n",
    "    - Or should I be testing a hypothesis on whether it can accurately predict windspeed within a range like within 5km/h difference?\n",
    "    - Do I need a probability for the hypothesis for all the analyses? Or is it fine if only the logistic regression provides a proability?\n",
    "- The prompt says preregister \"at least two analyses\", but I can think of six that would be interesting, is this fine?\n",
    "    - Between Model 1-3, I want to show a progression of how I gradually improve the model by adding new components to it\n",
    "- I know you told me to use paragraph form instead of point form in the Phase 2 comments, but for this Phase 3, I still feel like using point form makes it easier to highlight each component of each analyses\n",
    "    - I feel like for a project with this complexity, using point form makes it easier to understand\n",
    "    - Piling everything into long paragraphs makes it seem boring and disorganized and hard to figure out the main points\n",
    "    - But I can switch to using paragraph form in the final draft\n",
    "- Also back to Phase 2, if you have read my GitHub repository, you know how much code there is...\n",
    "    - I didn't include the code in Phase 2 because there was way too much code and it was incredibly chaotic\n",
    "    - I will try to include the code in the final submission, but I hope the file size limit wouldn't be a problem...\n",
    "    - On that note, should we include the entire exploratory data analysis into the final submission?\n",
    "    - Or is it fine if we just include the useful parts where I actually do models with them and obtain hypothesis testing results?"
