This part of the data cleaning process is done in the Jupyter file named One_Hour_Windspeed_Data.ipynb.\n",

    "Firstly, I open the csv file using pandas.read.csv, and transfer the data inside the dataframe, including windspeed station names, 1-hour sustained windspeeds, wind directions and timing of highest windspeed into lists. Then, by matching these windspeed station names with a predefined list of available windspeed stations, I append each windspeed data into a 2D list that contains 32 sub-lists of windspeeds of each windspeed station, each sub-list containing windspeed data of each tropical cyclone at a specific station. For windspeed stations that have missing data, I append numpy.nan into the list. After that, I find the average of all the timings of highest windspeeds at each station, in order to check whether this timing is close enough to the timing of the closest point of approach. If not, then I replace the intensity, distance and bearing from Hong Kong at CPA with those variables at the timing of highest windspeeds, finding out the distance and bearing from HK using another Python program called Distance_Bearing_Calculator.ipynb.\n",

I also count the number of times each wind direction occur for each tropical cyclone, then output the wind directions count data into another new csv file named Wind_Direction_Data_Output.csv, with the rows again being each of the 102 tropical cyclones and each column being each of the 16 wind directions."
